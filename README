`Openshifter' is an experimental design study to figure out how microservice-based applications can and should be migrated in various forms.

The implementation is based on OpenShift, hence the (slightly non-creative and trademark-offensive) name.

First steps:
* first term  → python3 openshifter.py
* second term → sh testclient.sh

Note: !!! purposeful insecure design during prototyping phase !!!
